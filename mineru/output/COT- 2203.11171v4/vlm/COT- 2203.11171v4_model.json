Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9%)."

In an effort to address this shortcoming, Wei et al. (2022) have proposed chain-of-thought prompting, where a language model is prompted to generate a series of short sentences that mimic the reasoning process a person might employ in solving a task. For example, given the question \"If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\", instead of directly responding with \"5\", a language model would be prompted to respond with the entire chain-of-thought: \"There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) cars. The answer is 5.\" It has been observed that chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves model performance across a variety of multi-step reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022)."

Such an approach is analogous to the human experience that if multiple different ways of thinking lead to the same answer, one has greater confidence that the final answer is correct.

On all four language models, self-consistency improves over chain-of-thought prompting by a striking margin across all tasks. In particular, when used with PaLM-540B or GPT-3, self-consistency achieves new state-of-the-art levels of performance across arithmetic reasoning tasks, including GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (+17.9% absolute accuracy gains), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) (+11.0%), AQuA (Ling et al., 2017) (+12.2%), and across commonsense reasoning tasks such as StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (Clark et al., 2018) (+3.9%). In additional experiments, we show self-consistency can robustly boost performance on NLP tasks where adding a chain-of-thought might hurt performance compared to standard prompting (Ye & Durrett, 2022). We also show self-consistency significantly outperforms sample-and-rank, beam search, ensemble-based approaches, and is robust to sampling strategies and imperfect prompts."

Since language models are not perfect reasoners, the model might also produce an incorrect reasoning path or make a mistake in one of the reasoning steps (e.g., in Output 2), but such solutions are less likely to arrive at the same answer. That is, we hypothesize that correct reasoning processes, even if they are diverse, tend to have greater agreement in their final answer than incorrect processes."

So she has 9 eggs * $2 = $18.\" constitutes \\(\\mathbf{r}_i\\), while the answer 18 from the last sentence, \"The answer is $18\", is parsed as \\(\\mathbf{a}_i\\). After sampling multiple \\((\\mathbf{r}_i, \\mathbf{a}_i)\\) from the model's decoder, self-consistency applies a marginalization over \\(\\mathbf{r}_i\\) by taking a majority vote over \\(\\mathbf{a}_i\\), i.e., \\(\\arg \\max_a \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathbb{1}(\\mathbf{a}_i = a)\\), or as we defined as the most \"consistent\" answer among the final answer set."

Additionally, when aggregating the answers, the results in Table 1 show that the \"normalized\" weighted sum (i.e., Equation 1) yields a much higher accuracy compared to its unnormalized counterpart. For completeness, in Table 1 we also report the results by taking a \"weighted average\", i.e., each \\(a\\) gets a score of its weighted sum divided by \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\mathbb{1}(\\mathbf{a}_i = a)\\), which results in a much worse performance."

We took majority vote of the answers from greedy decoding in both approaches as an ensemble. Table 7 shows that compared to self-consistency, existing ensemble-based approaches achieve a much smaller gain. In addition, note that self-consistency is different from a typical model-ensemble approach, where multiple models are trained and their outputs are aggregated. Self-consistency acts more like a \"self-ensemble\" on top of a single language model. We additionally show the results of ensembling multiple models in Appendix A.1.3 where the model-ensembles perform much worse compared to self-consistency."

More recently, the importance of diversity in the reasoning processes has been noticed, but only leveraged via task-specific training, either through an additional QA model over extracted reasoning paths (Chen et al., 2019), or by the introduction of latent variables in a commonsense knowledge graph (Yu et al., 2022). Compared to these approaches, self-consistency is far simpler and requires no additional training. The approach we propose simply couples the generation of reasoning paths and a final answer by sampling from the decoder, using aggregation to recover the most consistent answer without additional modules."

As part of future work, one could use self-consistency to generate better supervised data to fine-tune the model, such that the model can give more accurate predictions in a single inference run after fine-tuning. In addition, we observed that language models can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical reasoning paths (e.g., the StrategyQA example in Table 4, the two population numbers are not exactly correct), and further work is needed to better ground models' rationale generations."

This means the original price was 100%. 25% of 100% is 25%. So the original price was 100% - 25% = 75%. The original price was 75% of $19.50. 75% of $19.50 is 75% * $19.50 = $14.625. The answer is $14.625.</td><td>The original price of the book is $19.50. Since it was discounted by 25%, the original price was 19.50 / 0.75 = 26. The answer is 26.</td><td>Kyle bought a book that is sold for $19.50. With a 25% discount, the original price must be higher. If we call the original price x, then the discounted price is 0.75x. Since this is $19.50, we can write 0.75x = 19.50. Solving this, we find that the original price is x = 19.50 / 0.75 = $26.

So the answer is (d)</td><td>The volume of the tank is 8 m * 6 m * 2.5 m = 120 m3. One cubic meter contains 1000 litres, so the tank contains 120 m3 * 1000 liters/m3 = 120,000 liters.

The Great Depression is not a disease. Thus, Prozac cannot treat the Great Depression. So the answer is no.</td><td>The Great Depression is a time period.
