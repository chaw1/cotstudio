In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9%)."

In an effort to address this shortcoming, Wei et al. (2022) have proposed chain-of-thought prompting, where a language model is prompted to generate a series of short sentences that mimic the reasoning process a person might employ in solving a task. For example, given the question \"If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\", instead of directly responding with \"5\", a language model would be prompted to respond with the entire chain-of-thought: \"There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive.

We first prompt the language model with chain-of-thought prompting, then instead of greedily decoding the optimal reasoning path, we propose a \"sample-and-marginalize\" decoding procedure: we first sample from the language model's decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths; each reasoning path might lead to a different final answer, so we determine the optimal answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths to find the most consistent answer in the final answer set. Such an approach is analogous to the human experience that if multiple different ways of thinking lead to the same answer, one has greater confidence that the final answer is correct. Compared to other decoding methods, self-consistency avoids the repetitiveness and local-optimality that plague greedy decoding, while mitigating the stochasticity of a single sampled generation."

Instead, self-consistency is entirely unsupervised, works off-the-shelf with pre-trained language models, requires no additional human annotation, and avoids any additional training, auxiliary models or fine-tuning. Self-consistency also differs from a typical ensemble approach where multiple models are trained and the outputs from each model are aggregated, it acts more like a \"self-ensemble\" that works on top of a single language model."

On all four language models, self-consistency improves over chain-of-thought prompting by a striking margin across all tasks. In particular, when used with PaLM-540B or GPT-3, self-consistency achieves new state-of-the-art levels of performance across arithmetic reasoning tasks, including GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (+17.9% absolute accuracy gains), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) (+11.0%), AQuA (Ling et al., 2017) (+12.2%), and across commonsense reasoning tasks such as StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (Clark et al., 2018) (+3.9%). In additional experiments, we show self-consistency can robustly boost performance on NLP tasks where adding a chain-of-thought might hurt performance compared to standard prompting (Ye & Durrett, 2022). We also show self-consistency significantly outperforms sample-and-rank, beam search, ensemble-based approaches, and is robust to sampling strategies and imperfect prompts."

It is natural to suppose that in tasks requiring deliberate thinking, there are likely several ways to attack the problem. We propose that such a process can be simulated in language models via sampling from the language model's decoder. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, a model can generate several plausible responses to a math question that all arrive at the same correct answer (Outputs 1 and 3). Since language models are not perfect reasoners, the model might also produce an incorrect reasoning path or make a mistake in one of the reasoning steps (e.g., in Output 2), but such solutions are less likely to arrive at the same answer. That is, we hypothesize that correct reasoning processes, even if they are diverse, tend to have greater agreement in their final answer than incorrect processes."

Similarly, self-consistency yields large gains across all four language models, and obtained SoTA results on 5 out of 6 tasks. For symbolic reasoning, we test the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting where the input prompt contains examples of 2-letters or 2-flips but we test examples of 4-letters and 4-flips (this setting is more challenging as PaLM-540B or GPT-3 can already achieve perfect in-distribution accuracy). In this challenging OOD setting, the gain of self-consistency is still quite significant compared to CoT-prompting with sufficient model sizes."

The results show that sampling a higher number (e.g., 40) of reasoning paths leads to a consistently better performance, further emphasizing the importance of introducing diversity in the reasoning paths. In Table 4, we show self-consistency yields a richer set of reasoning paths compared to greedy decoding with a few example questions from two tasks."

We compare self-consistency with sample-and-rank on GPT-3 code-davinci-001, by sampling the same number of sequences from the decoder as self-consistency and taking the final answer from the top-ranked sequence. The results are shown in Figure 3. While sample-and-rank does improve the accuracy with additionally sampled sequences and ranking, the gain is much smaller compared to self-consistency."

For a fair comparison we report the accuracy under the same number of beams and reasoning paths. On both tasks self-consistency outperforms beam search significantly. Note self-consistency can also adopt beam search to decode each reasoning path (results are shown as \"Self-consistency using beam search\"), but its performance is worse compared to self-consistency with sampling. The reason is that beam search yields a lower diversity in the outputs (Li & Jurafsky, 2016), while in self-consistency the diversity of the reasoning paths is the key to a better performance."

In particular, we consider ensembling by: (1) prompt order permutation: we randomly permute the exemplars in the prompt 40 times to mitigate model's sensitivity to prompt order (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021); and (2) multiple sets of prompts (Gao et al., 2021): we manually write 3 different sets of prompts. We took majority vote of the answers from greedy decoding in both approaches as an ensemble. Table 7 shows that compared to self-consistency, existing ensemble-based approaches achieve a much smaller gain. In addition, note that self-consistency is different from a typical model-ensemble approach, where multiple models are trained and their outputs are aggregated. Self-consistency acts more like a \"self-ensemble\" on top of a single language model. We additionally show the results of ensembling multiple models in Appendix A.1.3 where the model-ensembles perform much worse compared to self-consistency."

Some previous work has considered task-specific approaches for identifying reasoning paths, such as constructing semantic graphs (Xu et al., 2021a), learning an RNN to retrieve reasoning paths over the Wikipedia graph (Asai et al., 2020), fine-tuning with human annotated reasoning paths on math problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), or training an extractor with heuristic-based pseudo reasoning paths (Chen et al., 2019). More recently, the importance of diversity in the reasoning processes has been noticed, but only leveraged via task-specific training, either through an additional QA model over extracted reasoning paths (Chen et al., 2019), or by the introduction of latent variables in a commonsense knowledge graph (Yu et al., 2022). Compared to these approaches, self-consistency is far simpler and requires no additional training. The approach we propose simply couples the generation of reasoning paths and a final answer by sampling from the decoder, using aggregation to recover the most consistent answer without additional modules."

Some prior work has shown that language models can suffer from inconsistency in conversation (Adiwardana et al., 2020), explanation generation (Camburu et al., 2020), and factual knowledge extraction (Elazar et al., 2021). Welleck et al. (2020) use \"consistency\" to refer to generating an infinite-length sequence in recurrent language models. Nye et al. (2021) improve the logical consistency of samples from a System 1 model by adding a System 2-inspired logical reasoning module. In this paper we focus on a slightly different notion of \"consistency\", i.e., utilizing answer consistency among diverse reasoning paths to improve accuracy."

In practice people can try a small number of paths (e.g., 5 or 10) as a starting point to realize most of the gains while not incurring too much cost, as in most cases the performance saturates quickly (Figure 2). As part of future work, one could use self-consistency to generate better supervised data to fine-tune the model, such that the model can give more accurate predictions in a single inference run after fine-tuning. In addition, we observed that language models can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical reasoning paths (e.g., the StrategyQA example in Table 4, the two population numbers are not exactly correct), and further work is needed to better ground models' rationale generations."

Two of them are public models: UL2 is a completely open-sourced model with model checkpoints available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ul2; GPT-3 is also a public model with public API available at https://openai.com/api/. For GPT-3, we have included two public engines (\"code-davinci-001\" and \"code-davinci-002\") to further aid reproducibility, as Codex is currently free so anyone can reproduce the results. In addition, as our results make use of LaMDA-137B and PaLM-540B that are not publicly available, we provide the exact input prompts for all tasks in Appendix A.3 (and note that we do not perform any finetuning and only apply prompting to off-the-shelf language models)."

We deal with reasoning tasks mostly and the generated rationales are only used for inspecting how a model reaches its answer. One could potentially use the generated rationales to further check why the model makes certain mistakes or whether the model contains any biases when performing a certain task. For language model in real-world use, further work is needed to better ground models' predictions and improve model's factuality and safety, to ensure the models do not cause harms to users."

This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?</td><td>The book was sold for $19.50. This is 25% less than the original price. This means the original price was 100%. 25% of 100% is 25%. So the original price was 100% - 25% = 75%. The original price was 75% of $19.50. 75% of $19.50 is 75% * $19.50 = $14.625. The answer is $14.625.</td><td>The original price of the book is $19.50. Since it was discounted by 25%, the original price was 19.50 / 0.75 = 26. The answer is 26.</td><td>Kyle bought a book that is sold for $19.50. With a 25% discount, the original price must be higher. If we call the original price x, then the discounted price is 0.75x. Since this is $19.50, we can write 0.75x = 19.50. Solving this, we find that the original price is x = 19.50 / 0.75 = $26. The answer is $26.</td></tr><tr><td>[AQuA] The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m x 6 m x 2.5 m) is (a) 120 litres (b) 1200 litres (c) 12000 litres (d) 120000 litres (e) None of these</td><td>The volume of the tank is 8 m * 6 m * 2.5 m = 120 m3. So the capacity of the tank is 120 m3. So the answer is (c).</td><td>The volume of the tank is 8m * 6m* 2.5m = 120m3. This is equal to 120000 litres. So the answer is (d)</td><td>The volume of the tank is 8 m * 6 m * 2.5 m = 120 m3. One cubic meter contains 1000 litres, so the tank contains 120 m3 * 1000 liters/m3 = 120,000 liters. So the answer is (d).</td></tr><tr><td>[StrategyQA] Yes or no: Can the Great Depression be treated with Prozac?</td><td>The Great Depression was an economic depression. Prozac is a drug used to treat depression. Thus, the Great Depression could be treated with Prozac. So the answer is yes.</td><td>Prozac is an anti-depressant medication. The Great Depression is not a disease. Thus, Prozac cannot treat the Great Depression. So the answer is no.</td><td>The Great Depression is a time period. Prozac is used to treat depression (the mental illness). Thus, the Great Depression can not be treated with Prozac. So the answer is no.</td></tr><tr><td>[ARC-easy] Which source of energy is nonrenewable? (a) coal. (b) sunlight. (c) water.

So the answer is (a).</td><td>Coal is a fossil fuel and is formed from dead organisms from the past. Coal cannot be produced in a short period of time, so it is considered a nonrenewable source of energy.

The answer is (a).\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22, then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (a) 1/2 (b) 3/2 (c) 5/2 (d) 4/2 (e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b).\nQ: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance? Answer Choices: (a) 53 km (b) 55 km (c) 52 km (d) 60 km (e) 50 km\nA: The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km.
