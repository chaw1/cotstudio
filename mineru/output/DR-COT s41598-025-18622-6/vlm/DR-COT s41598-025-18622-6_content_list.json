        "text": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has revolutionized reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle complex tasks by mimicking step-by-step human thought processes. However, traditional CoT methods often suffer from high computational costs and context dilution, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in resource-constrained or real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Recursive Chain-of-Thought (DR-CoT), a novel reasoning framework for parameter-efficient models. DR-CoT synergistically integrates recursive reasoning, dynamic context truncation, and a voting mechanism. By selectively retaining the most salient context within a fixed token budget and aggregating inferences from multiple independent reasoning chains, DR-CoT significantly enhances reasoning accuracy. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPOA Diamond and AIME2024, demonstrate the efficacy of DR-CoT. On GPOA Diamond, DR-CoT sees Pass@1 accuracy gains of  $1.5\\%$  for Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental,  $2.7\\%$  for Grok 3 Beta, and  $4.4\\%$  for o3 Mini. Similarly, AIME2024 results reveal consistent improvements of 3-4 percentage points across evaluated models. Furthermore, DR-CoT enhances zero-shot classification performance on GPOA Diamond, enabling compact BERT-sized models to surpass larger language models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 2. In code generation tasks using HumanEval, DRCoT empowers models to exceed the performance of established frontier LLMs, including LLaMA 70B, Phi-3, and Claude Sonnet. These comprehensive results underscore DR-CoT's effectiveness in bridging the performance gap between parameter-efficient models and state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple domains.",

First, the recursive process allows the model to incrementally refine its reasoning by continuously updating its context with the most relevant intermediate steps, thus reducing noise from less pertinent information. Second, dynamic context truncation ensures that the model operates within resource constraints by discarding extraneous data while preserving critical reasoning cues. Finally, by aggregating outputs from multiple independent reasoning chains via a voting mechanism, DR-CoT mitigates errors from any single chain and converges on a consensus final answer. Together, these mechanisms enable a self-correcting approach to complex problem-solving.",

The base versions of the models exhibit a lower overall memory footprint compared to their large counterparts, with an average VRAM usage of 4.29 GB without DR-CoT and 7.00 GB with DR-CoT. Meanwhile, large models require significantly more VRAM, averaging 9.4 GB without DR-CoT and 11.6 GB with DR-CoT. The increase in VRAM usage due to DR-CoT varies slightly across models, with the smallest increase observed in ROBERTa-large and ModernBERT-large (2 GB), while other models experience an increase ranging between 2 and 3 GB. Notably, ModernBERT-base exhibits the lowest VRAM usage without DR-CoT (3 GB), whereas ROBERTa-large and ModernBERT-large require the most memory (12 GB) when DR-CoT is applied. These findings suggest that while DR-CoT increases VRAM usage in all models, the relative increase remains within a reasonable range of 2 to 3 GB, making it a feasible enhancement to improve model performance without excessive computational cost.",

Conversely, the successful prediction (Base  $0 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow$  Final 0), while ultimately correct, also demonstrated notable fluctuations in its reasoning path. This indicates an inherent instability might exist within the refinement steps, even when the final outcome is accurate.

By retaining only the most relevant context within a fixed token limit and aggregating outputs from multiple independent reasoning chains. Our evaluations on challenging benchmarks such as GPQA Diamond and AIME2024 demonstrate consistent delta performance gains across diverse model architectures, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Moreover, experiments on the HumanEval benchmark further validate DR-CoT-s impact on code generation tasks, where DR-CoT-enabled models not only close the gap but, in many cases, outperform larger state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA2-70B.

For example, the system could estimate task difficulty through initial confidence scores or uncertainty measures, and subsequently allocate more reasoning chains to challenging questions while reducing the number for simpler instances. This adaptive strategy could maintain, or even enhance, overall accuracy while reducing computational cost. Additionally, we plan to investigate lightweight approximations and model pruning techniques to further streamline the voting process. These methods have the potential to make our DR-CoT framework more scalable and efficient for real-world applications, where computational resources are often limited. By incorporating these adaptive mechanisms, we aim to achieve a more balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning accuracy.",
