The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information (\"LLM thoughts\") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by \\(62\\%\\) over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by \\(>31\\%\\). We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks."

This is motivated by numerous phenomena such as human reasoning, brain structure, or algorithmic execution. When working on a novel idea, a human would not only follow a chain of thoughts (as in CoT) or try different separate ones (as in ToT), but would actually form a more complex network of thoughts. For example, one could explore a certain chain of reasoning, backtrack and start a new one, then realize that a certain idea from the previous chain could be combined with the currently explored one, and merge them both into a new solution, taking advantage of their strengths and eliminating their weaknesses. Similarly, brains form complex networks, with graph-like patterns such as recurrence [28]. Executing algorithms also expose networked patterns, often represented by Directed Acyclic Graphs. The corresponding graph-enabled transformations bring a promise of more powerful prompting when applied to LLM thoughts, but they are not naturally expressible with CoT or ToT."

It enhances CoT-SC by modeling the process or reasoning as a tree of thoughts. A single tree node represents a partial solution. Based on a given node, the thought generator constructs a given number \\( k \\) of new nodes. Then, the state evaluator generates scores for each such new node. Depending on the use case, the evaluation could be conducted using an LLM itself, or it can harness human scores. Finally, the schedule of extending the tree is dictated by the utilized search algorithm (for example BFS or DFS)."

Note that, from the graph theory perspective, the GRS is identical to that in the operation Generate(t, k=4) The difference between these two is that Generate(t, k=4) gives the user more freedom to choose the thought constructed, while Generate(t, k=1) \\(^+\\) Repeat \\((\\mathrm{k} = 4)\\) is less flexible but more easy to use. Moreover, with Repeat one has 4 context-isolated responses from the LLM for identical prompts, whereas without Repeat there is only one context where all 4 thoughts are generated and must be explicitly handled in a single prompt/session."

Wang et al. proposed Plan-and-Solve, an approach to enhance CoT with an explicit planning stage [65]. Using complexity-based criteria to enhance prompting within a CoT was designed by Fu et al. [66, 29]. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) [79] generates several chain of thoughts, and selects the ones that are valid. Similarly, a scheme by Shum et al. [60] generates a pool of CoT candidates, and selects the best candidate based on whether the candidates match the ground truth and on a policy gradient-based method. Automatic prompt generation overcomes the issues of scaling in CoT [58, 42, 41]. Zhou et al. proposes to harness selecting the best prompt out of a candidate set [83]."

The graph abstraction has been fruitful for many modern research domains, such as social sciences (e.g., studying human interactions), bioinformatics (e.g., analyzing protein structures), chemistry (e.g., designing chemical compounds), medicine (e.g., drug discovery), cybersecurity (e.g., identifying intruder machines), healthcare (e.g., exposing groups of people who submit fraudulent claims), web graph analysis (e.g., providing accurate search services), entertainment services (e.g., predicting movie popularity), linguistics (e.g., modeling relationships between words), transportation (e.g., finding efficient routes), physics (e.g., understanding phase transitions and critical phenomena), and many others [44, 20, 38, 35, 15].

This enables novel transformations of thoughts, such as aggregation. Human's task solving is often non-linear, and it involves combining intermediate solutions into final ones, or changing the flow of reasoning upon discovering new insights. GoT reflects this with its graph structure."
