# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on redesigning the entire project's UI layout and styling to create a more professional and user-friendly interface. The current layout has issues with modal positioning, navigation structure, and overall visual appeal. The new design will feature a clean left navigation bar with user controls at the bottom, a main content area, and properly positioned modals that avoid overlapping with the navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive layout with a left navigation bar and main content area, so that I can easily navigate through the application and focus on my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a left navigation bar with a fixed width
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a main content area that takes up the remaining screen space
3. WHEN viewing any page THEN the navigation bar SHALL remain visible and accessible
4. WHEN the screen is resized THEN the layout SHALL remain responsive and functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want user-related controls (login, settings, management) positioned at the bottom of the navigation bar, so that I can easily access account functions without cluttering the main navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL display user login controls at the bottom section
2. WHEN viewing the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL display settings options at the bottom section
3. WHEN viewing the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL display management options at the bottom section
4. WHEN clicking on user controls THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate functionality without disrupting the main layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all modal dialogs and popups to appear in the main content area without being obscured by the navigation bar, so that I can interact with them properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a modal dialog opens THEN the system SHALL position it in the center of the main content area
2. WHEN a modal dialog opens THEN the system SHALL ensure it does not overlap with the left navigation bar
3. WHEN the OCR processing dialog opens THEN the system SHALL display it properly centered in the main area
4. WHEN any functional popup opens THEN the system SHALL ensure full visibility and accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved visual design with better colors, typography, and spacing, so that the application looks professional and is pleasant to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL use a consistent and professional color scheme
2. WHEN viewing text content THEN the system SHALL use readable typography with appropriate font sizes
3. WHEN viewing interface elements THEN the system SHALL have proper spacing and alignment
4. WHEN interacting with buttons and controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user working with project management and OCR processing, I want the interface to clearly separate different functional areas, so that I can efficiently manage my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing project management THEN the system SHALL clearly display project-related functions in the main area
2. WHEN starting OCR processing THEN the system SHALL show processing options in a well-positioned dialog
3. WHEN viewing different sections THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency across all areas
4. WHEN switching between functions THEN the system SHALL preserve the layout structure and user context
