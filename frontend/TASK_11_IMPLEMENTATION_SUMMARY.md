  - Tabbed interface for different aspects
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Project information display
  - Integrated file management
  - Placeholder tabs for future features (OCR, CoT, KG)

- **Requirements Satisfied:**
  - ✅ 1.4: Project detail view
  - ✅ File list display and status monitoring

### 5. Updated Projects Page (`src/pages/Projects.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - State management for different views (list, detail, form)
  - Integration with project hooks and services
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
  - Navigation between list and detail views

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `date-fns`: For relative time formatting
- React DnD already available for drag-and-drop functionality

### State Management

2. Click "新建项目" to create a new project
3. Click on a project name to view details
4. Use the file upload area to add documents
5. Monitor file processing status in the file list
